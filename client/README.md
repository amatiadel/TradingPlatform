# React Trading Platform with localStorage Persistence

This React trading platform now includes localStorage persistence to maintain all trading data, balances, and settings across page refreshes.

## Features

### Persistence
- **Current Trades**: All active trades with expiry time, line price, type, amount, and pair are saved
- **Balance**: Both demo and real account balances are preserved
- **Trade History**: Completed trades are maintained
- **Line Positions**: Trade lines on the chart are restored at their saved price levels
- **User Settings**: Selected time (expiry), investment amount, trading pair, and timeframe are saved
- **Account Type**: Demo/Real account selection is preserved

### Automatic State Management
- **On Page Load**: Automatically loads saved state from localStorage
- **Expired Trade Processing**: Automatically resolves expired trades and updates balances
- **Trade Line Cleanup**: Expired trade lines are automatically removed from the chart
- **Real-time Saving**: All state changes are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Chart Restoration**: Trade lines are redrawn at their saved price levels with correct remaining time

### Bug Fixes
- **Trade Line Removal**: Trade lines now disappear immediately when countdown ends
- **Timeframe Persistence**: Selected timeframe is preserved across page refreshes
- **Active Trade Restoration**: Active trades are properly restored with correct remaining time and lines

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Utility (`utils/storage.js`)
```javascript
export const saveState = (key, value) => {
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
};

export const loadState = (key, defaultValue) => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem(key);
  return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : defaultValue;
};
```

### Storage Keys
- `trading_platform_trades_by_symbol`: All trades organized by symbol
- `trading_platform_demo_balance`: Demo account balance
- `trading_platform_real_balance`: Real account balance
- `trading_platform_trade_lines_per_symbol`: Trade lines for chart restoration
- `trading_platform_selected_time`: User's selected expiry time
- `trading_platform_selected_investment`: User's selected investment amount
- `trading_platform_selected_pair`: User's selected trading pair
- `trading_platform_selected_timeframe`: User's selected chart timeframe
- `trading_platform_account_type`: Account type (demo/real)

### Key Functions
- `saveToStorage()`: Saves all current state to localStorage
- `loadFromStorage()`: Loads all state from localStorage with defaults
- `processExpiredTrades()`: Processes expired trades and updates balances
- `processExpiredTradeLines()`: Removes expired trade lines from state
- `restoreTradeLines()`: Restores trade lines on the chart with proper state updates

## Usage

The persistence is completely automatic. Users can:
1. Place trades normally
2. Refresh the page at any time
3. Return to find all their data exactly as it was
4. See expired trades automatically resolved
5. Continue trading with their preserved balance and settings
6. Trade lines disappear immediately when trades expire
7. Selected timeframe is maintained across refreshes

## Browser Compatibility

This implementation uses the standard `localStorage` API, which is supported in all modern browsers.

## Data Safety

- All data is stored locally in the browser
- No data is sent to external servers for persistence
- Data persists until the browser cache is cleared
- Error handling prevents crashes if localStorage is unavailable
- Expired trades and lines are automatically cleaned up on page load
